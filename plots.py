"""
Plots:
• Generate a plot of top center surface temperature versus time during the heating process
for these three materials using both the lumped capacitance and finite difference methods.
• (550 only) Show a 2D plot of the temperature profile across the full plancha at one-half of
the time to heat up for the material that is slowest to come to operating temperature.
